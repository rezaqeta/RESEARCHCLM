## 📊 OPTION A: Testing an Intervention

### When to Choose This:
- ✅ You have a specific intervention idea (e.g., nudges, education, feedback)
- ✅ You want to know "Does this work?"
- ✅ You want to measure effectiveness quantitatively
- ✅ You can recruit 100+ participants
- ✅ You have 12-24 months

### Methodology: **Quasi-Experimental or RCT Design**

#### Basic Structure:
```
Intervention Group:  [Pre-test] → [INTERVENTION] → [Post-test] → [Follow-up]
Control Group:       [Pre-test] → [No change]    → [Post-test] → [Follow-up]
                          ↓              ↓              ↓             ↓
                        Week 0        Weeks 1-8      Week 9        Week 17
```

### Example Interventions:
1. **Nudge**: Change default settings (opt-out recycling instead of opt-in)
2. **Feedback**: Provide households with energy use comparisons to neighbors
3. **Education**: Workshop on climate change + behavior impact
4. **Gamification**: Mobile app with challenges and rewards
5. **Social norms**: Display messages about others' behaviors

### Data You'll Collect:
- **Behaviors**: Self-report or objective (energy bills, waste data, etc.)
- **Psychological factors**: Attitudes, knowledge, self-efficacy
- **Demographics**: Age, gender, income, education

### Analysis:
- Statistical tests comparing intervention vs. control group
- Effect size calculation (How much did it work?)
- Testing mechanisms (Why did it work?)

### Outputs:
- 📄 Journal article with effectiveness results
- 📊 Policy brief with recommendations
- 🎤 Conference presentations

### Time & Resources:
- ⏱️ **Timeline**: 12-18 months
- 👥 **Team**: You + 1-2 research assistants (helpful)
- 💰 **Budget**: Low-Medium (participant incentives, software)
- 🎓 **Skills**: Survey design, statistics

### Pros:
- ✅ Can make causal claims ("X caused Y")
- ✅ Provides concrete evidence for policy
- ✅ Publishable in top-tier journals
- ✅ Directly actionable results

### Cons:
- ❌ Doesn't explain *why* deeply
- ❌ Requires larger sample size
- ❌ More complex logistics
- ❌ May have recruitment challenges

### **ENHANCEMENT**: Add interviews to explain findings → **MIXED METHODS**

---

## 💬 OPTION C: Understanding Experiences

### When to Choose This:
- ✅ You want to know "Why do people do/not do environmental behaviors?"
- ✅ You want rich, deep insights
- ✅ You want to explore new territory
- ✅ You have 20-40 participants available
- ✅ You have 8-12 months

### Methodology: **Qualitative Study (Interviews or Focus Groups)**

### Interview Topics (Example):
1. Current environmental behaviors and reasons
2. Barriers and facilitators
3. Social influences (family, friends, community)
4. Emotions and values related to climate
5. Past attempts to change
6. Ideas for interventions

### Data You'll Collect:
- Audio-recorded interviews (with consent)
- Transcripts (verbatim text)
- Field notes and observations
- Maybe: photos, documents, social media

### Analysis:

- **Framework Analysis**: Use COM-B or other theory to organize findings
- Quotes illustrate each theme

### Outputs:
- 📄 Journal article with in-depth insights
- 🎨 Visual models/diagrams of findings
- 💡 Recommendations for intervention design

### Time & Resources:
- ⏱️ **Timeline**: 8-12 months

- 💰 **Budget**: Low (recording device, transcription, small incentives)
- 🎓 **Skills**: Interviewing, listening, thematic coding

### Pros:
- ✅ Deep, rich understanding
- ✅ Can discover unexpected insights
- ✅ Flexible and adaptable
- ✅ Smaller sample size needed
- ✅ Can do independently

### Cons:
- ❌ Cannot generalize to whole population
- ❌ No statistical testing

### **BEST USE**: Exploratory research before designing intervention (Option A)

---

## 📚 OPTION B: Systematic Review

### When to Choose This:
- ✅ You want to know "What does existing research tell us?"
- ✅ You want to identify research gaps
- ✅ You want to synthesize evidence before designing your own study
- ✅ You have access to academic databases
- ✅ You have 6-12 months

### Methodology: **Systematic Review + Meta-Analysis**

#### Basic Structure:
```
Define Question → Search Databases → Screen Studies → Extract Data → Analyze → Report
    (PICO)       (systematic)      (title, abstract,  (code)      (synthesize)  (PRISMA)
                                    full-text)
```

### Research Questions You Can Answer:
- What behavioral interventions are most effective?
- What factors predict pro-environmental behavior?
- How does context influence effectiveness?
- What are the gaps in current research?

### Process:
1. **Define question** using PICO:
   - **P**opulation: Who?
   - **I**ntervention/Exposure: What?
   - **C**omparison: Compared to what?
   - **O**utcome: What result?

2. **Search** multiple databases (PubMed, Web of Science, etc.)
3. **Screen** hundreds of papers (title → abstract → full text)
4. **Extract** data from included studies
5. **Analyze**: 
   - Narrative synthesis (descriptive summary)
   - OR Meta-analysis (statistical pooling of effects)
6. **Report** following PRISMA guidelines

### Data You'll Collect:
- Study characteristics (author, year, sample size)
- Intervention details
- Outcome measures
- Effect sizes (if meta-analysis)
- Quality ratings

### Outputs:
- 📄 High-impact journal article (systematic reviews are highly cited)
- 📊 Evidence summary for policymakers
- 🔍 Identification of research gaps → guides your next study

### Time & Resources:
- ⏱️ **Timeline**: 6-12 months
- 👥 **Team**: You + 1 co-reviewer (for screening reliability)
- 💰 **Budget**: Very low (database access, reference manager)
- 🎓 **Skills**: Literature search, critical appraisal, synthesis

### Pros:
- ✅ No primary data collection needed
- ✅ Highly publishable
- ✅ Comprehensive overview of field
- ✅ Identifies gaps for future research
- ✅ Can do from anywhere

### Cons:
- ❌ No new empirical data

- ❌ Can be tedious

### **BEST USE**: Foundation for designing your primary research study

---

## 🔄 OPTION D: Mixed Methods (RECOMMENDED)

### When to Choose This:
- ✅ You want the best of both worlds (quant + qual)
- ✅ You want to know "Does it work AND why?"
- ✅ You have adequate time and resources
- ✅ You want comprehensive, actionable results

### Methodology: **Mixed Methods Sequential Explanatory Design**

#### Structure:
```
Phase 1: QUANTITATIVE                    Phase 2: QUALITATIVE
(Intervention study)                     (Interviews)
        │                                       │
        ▼                                       ▼
Test intervention → Analyze results → Select participants → Interview → Explain findings
(200-300 people)   (stats)           (20-30 people)       (why?)     (integrate)
```

### How It Works:
1. **Phase 1**: Run intervention study (like Option A)
   - Measure effectiveness quantitatively
   - Identify what worked, what didn't
   
2. **Phase 2**: Interview participants (like Option C)
   - Select high responders, low responders, non-responders
   - Ask *why* results turned out as they did
   - Explore barriers, facilitators, experiences

3. **Integration**: Combine findings
   - Qualitative explains quantitative
   - Create joint displays showing both
   - Develop comprehensive understanding

### Example Integration:

| Quantitative Finding | Qualitative Explanation | Insight |
|---------------------|------------------------|---------|
| Energy use ↓30% in intervention group (p<.001) | Participants said smart meter feedback made energy use "visible" and social comparison motivated them | Feedback + social norms are key mechanisms |
| No change in meat consumption (p=.52) | Participants felt giving up meat threatened cultural identity and family meals | Cultural barriers must be addressed for dietary interventions |

### Outputs:
- 📄 Main mixed-methods paper (high impact)
- 📄 Secondary qual paper (mechanisms deep-dive)
- 📊 Policy brief with "what works" and "how to implement"
- 🎤 Multiple conference presentations

### Time & Resources:
- ⏱️ **Timeline**: 18-24 months
- 👥 **Team**: You + 2 research assistants
- 💰 **Budget**: Medium (incentives, software, transcription)
- 🎓 **Skills**: Both quantitative and qualitative methods

### Pros:
- ✅ Most comprehensive understanding
- ✅ Complements strengths of each method
- ✅ Highly publishable in top journals
- ✅ Directly actionable for policy/practice
- ✅ Answers "what", "how much", and "why"

### Cons:
- ❌ Most time-intensive
- ❌ Requires diverse skill set
- ❌ More expensive
- ❌ Complex analysis and integration

### **BEST FOR**: Dissertation, funded research project, or ambitious thesis
