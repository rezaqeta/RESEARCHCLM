Behavior Change for Nature
"An extremely well-crafted summary of what behavioral research 
has taught us about better design of public policy and how we 
can apply that to the environmental field." 
Robert Frank, Professor of Economics at Cornell University and 
author of Microeconomics and Behavior
"At the end of the day we’re only going to make conservation 
work when we can change lots of places on the ground and that 
means helping lots of people change too. I think the approach 
here allows us to do that faster, better, and in a way that enables 
us to keep up with the threats we’re facing across the planet." 
Aileen Lee, Chief Program Officer, Environmental Conservation 
Program, Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation

Foreword
We are fortunate to live in a world filled with both an abundance and diversity of life. Yet the growing scale and impact 
of human behavior pose a grave risk to the natural world in irreversible ways. Of the many challenges that we see 
in the world today, biodiversity loss and the degradation of natural systems are increasingly ones that threatens the 
livelihoods, health, and well-being of people as well as the species and places we know and love.
So imagine you are managing a team within a conservation organization, tasked with developing a strategy to curb the 
trade of illegal tiger products in South-East Asia and to prevent overfishing in a coastal municipality in the Philippines. 
From what you know, both are complex problems and require a holistic approach to creating solutions. You imagine 
a long road ahead of research, field visits, and endless meetings about what’s working and not working. You feel the 
pressure from the importance and urgency of these global problems and want to develop interventions that last and 
make a difference. Where do you even begin? 
Our past and current efforts in facing these challenges have tended to rely on a standard toolbox that enacts 
regulations, provides financial incentives or disincentives, and raises awareness about the dire consequences of our bad 
behavior. In addition to these tools, in this report we suggest a greater focus on how our cognitive biases, emotions, 
social networks, and decision-making environments all impact our behaviors and choices. Our goal is to offer an 
introductory guide to these ideas, which can help us to identify the behavioral barriers and solutions to overcoming the 
world’s biggest conservation threats.
These approaches are still relatively new to the field of conservation and are increasingly familiar to other sectors. 
More than 100 governments and institutions have created ‘behavioral insights teams’ or ‘nudge units’ to improve 
policy by drawing on behavioral economics and psychology, and marketers and managers are becoming increasingly 
sophisticated in their ‘human-centered’ approach. Meanwhile, many development organizations and public health 
officials are starting to give behavior change interventions as much credence as conventional legislative, economic, or 
infrastructural programs to achieve positive social change. We would argue this is exactly how it should be. After all, 
many of society’s ailments and ambitions - from corruption and conflict to obesity and road safety - are ultimately about 
human behavior. Protecting our planet is no different.
We hope you’ll come away from this report with a clearer understanding that conservation is a behavioral challenge and 
therefore needs behaviorally-informed solutions. Here is your starting point with the tools and tactics to employ in your 
efforts to preserve our natural resources for current and future generations.
Onwards,

Executive Summary 
NATURE CONSERVATION  
IS ABOUT BEHAVIOR
In one way or another, as conservationists we are often 
trying to change someone’s behavior. Maybe your 
challenge is reducing the demand for rhino horn in China, 
or persuading Americans to adopt a plant rich diet, or 
convincing artisanal fishermen that by catching less today 
they may end up getting more tomorrow. Maybe you 
are trying to encourage residents of your district to stop 
throwing plastic into the river, or to motivate farmers in 
Colombia to adopt sustainable agricultural practices like 
silvopasture or cover crops. Or maybe you are trying 
to sway your local politicians to enact new policies 
that makes it easier to protect the species, habitats, or 
resources you care about. Whatever the case may be, 
you are here because you want to persuade, motivate, or 
otherwise enable someone to change their behavior.
In Chapter 1 , we explain why the daily decisions and 
actions of individuals and communities around the world 
are so central to conservation outcomes. We’ve identified 
five main categories of conservation threats as areas to 
apply our revised toolkit: habitat loss and degradation, 
overexploitation, illegal wildlife consumption, human-
wildlife conflict, and pollution. For each, we identify a 
number of target audiences and target behaviors that 
could help to mitigate the losses to natural systems we are 
seeing around the world. We also provide further details of 
these five conservation threats in Annex A .
CONVENTIONAL TOOLS CAN BE 
POWERFUL, BUT REST ON FLAWED 
ASSUMPTIONS
For more than a century, conservation efforts have 
relied on three key approaches to bringing about change: 
legislation and regulation; market forces and material 
incentives; and awareness and education. In Chapter 
2, we discuss the merits of these tools, but also their 
shortcomings. We highlight three fundamental insights 
from behavioral science which provide a new perspective 
on conventional wisdom: the need to focus on non-
conscious as well as conscious drivers of behavior; the 
need to focus on the setting of our behaviors as well as 
internal motives and drivers; and the need to focus on 
behaviors rather than solely beliefs, attitudes, or intentions.
The evidence shows this new perspective is much needed 
in the field of conservation. Regulations, even well-designed, are difficult to enforce, especially in developing 
world contexts. Material incentives can be powerful, but 
they are difficult to design well and can produce myriad 
unintended consequences. And raising awareness on its 
own rarely leads to changed hearts and minds, let alone 
desired environmental outcomes – knowledge simply 
doesn’t equate to action.
NEW STRATEGIES ARE NEEDED
A revolution in the science of human behavior over the past 
few decades has changed the way that we think about how 
people make decisions and revealed a new and growing set 
of insights that can aid us in designing solutions that work 
for everyday people from fishers, to tourists, to government 
officials. In particular, these insights highlight that we 
must change our prevailing assumptions about our target 
audiences. Our choices are not made solely on the basis of 
fully conscious, deliberate, or even rational processing of 
information. We are emotional; we are embedded in social 
networks; and are influenced by the context of decisions 
and the way choices are presented. 
In Chapter 3 , we collate key findings from behavioral 
science and propose 15 strategies. These are broadly 
categorized into three categories, which capture the 
main drivers of behavior change: motivate the change, by 
harnessing the right incentives, emotions, and cognitive 
biases; socialize the change, leveraging the deeply social 
nature of our behavior; and ease the change, by removing 
hassle, helping people plan, and building supporting 
environments. Conventional legislation, incentives, and 
education still have their place and may still be the most 
effective intervention in some situations. However, 
where that is not the case, or where implementation and 
enforcement is impossible, these behavioral tools offer both 
an alternative and a new lens through which to think about 
the conventional tools.
PUTTING IT INTO PRACTICE
Armed with an understanding of behavioral science, and a 
new set of strategies, we turn our attention to the practical 
challenge on putting them into action. Doing so in a way 
that is scientifically rigorous, often in challenging conditions 
around the world, is no easy feat. In Chapter 4 , we show 
how both the Behavioral Insights Team (BIT) and Rare might 
apply these ideas in the real world, through hypothetical 
and real case studies of tackling the illegal wildlife trade and 
overfishing.

understand the drivers and barriers of behaviors in the real-
world context; both aim to embrace humility and elevate 
the experiences and insight of our target audience; and both aim to be rigorous in the way that solutions draw on 
good behavioral science and measure the impact of an 
intervention. In Annex B , we provide more detail on BIT’s 
approach to rigorous evaluation, ensuring that we learn from 
our efforts and build an understanding of what works and 
what does not.

physical health, by giving us beautiful places for recreation, 
spiritual and cultural grounding, and relaxation. Protecting 
biodiversity ensures that ecosystems, and by extension 
human and non-human communities, are more resilient 
and better able to cope with the adverse impacts of 
climate change.7 The economic value of the services 
provided by biodiversity assets and ecosystem services 
to the global economy is estimated to be US$125 trillion 
annually,8, 9 although its true price tag is impossible to 
calculate. Natural resources, and the material and immaterial 
benefits from ecosystem services, are not distributed 
equally and equitably around the world, often at the expense 
of poor, marginalized, and/or indigenous communities, who 
are unable to keep global markets from using their local 
resources.10, 11 Having a rich and ample supply of natural 
resources is not optional, but essential, for supporting all 
human communities across the world, no matter who you 
are.b
Humans’ impact on biodiversity
Like all species, humans have modified their environment 
in order to survive. Yet unlike other species, the rate 
and scale at which humans have modified our natural 
environment is unprecedented. Continued human 
population and economic growth have placed immense 
pressure on natural systems. Current biodiversity 
indicators show consistent declines, while the pressures 
on biodiversity continue to increase.12 For example, we 
have converted nearly 40 percent of forests into crop and 
pastureland, installed dams in 50 percent of the world’s 
rivers, and degraded 40 percent of the world’s oceans.13, 
14 As a result, scientists estimate a 60 percent decline in 
vertebrate species from 1970-2014, and current trends 
show us on a path to wipe out 90 percent of coral reefs by 
2050.15 Approximately 8,000 species of mammals, fish, 
amphibians, reptiles, and birds are threatened, and current 
species extinction rates are predicted to be 100 to 1,000 
times greater than pre-human rates.16, 17 
The past several decades have seen renewed calls to 
action for biodiversity conservation across the globe: 193 
nations signed the United Nations Convention on Biological 
Diversity; the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform 
on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services was created in 
2012; and there has been an increase in protected areas in 
addition to the many local efforts that support threatened 
or endangered species conservation.18 At the same time, 
there have been many advances in information gathering 
and reporting about the scale and extent of the challenge. 
We’ve learned that these advances, commitments, and 
b The inequity and inequality that result from natural resource extraction, destruction, and pollution are important and complex topics that inform our 
thinking and not discussed in depth here. We encourage readers to explore research and applications from fields such as environmental justice, environmental 
anthropology, and political ecology to learn more. regulations are not enough; most experts now agree 
that the worsening conditions are largely the result of 
human behaviors, especially through our consumption and 
pollution of natural resources.19, 20, 21 These data trends 
are warning signs that we must do more to change our 
behavior and preserve our remaining biodiversity for 
current and future generations, and we have the tools and 
technology to do so.
1.2 TARGET BEHAVIORS  
FOR CONSERVATION
There are numerous threats to nature in the world 
today, many if not most of which are caused by humans 
and therefore can be addressed at the scale of human 
behavior. We focus on five of these and provide a 
detailed description of each in Annex A: habitat loss and 
degradation, overexploitation, illegal wildlife trade, human-
wildlife conflict, and pollution.
We recognize that this list is simplified and not exhaustive; 
there are also many interconnections where one behavior 
impacts natural systems in multiple ways. Our selections 
are based on common categories of threats identified by 
the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), 
the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity 
(CBD), as well as Rare’s experience with conservation.
Each threat is driven by many smaller, everyday actions 
and decisions that conservation practitioners might aim 
to address – we refer to these as ‘target behaviors.’ Table 
1 provides a summary of the threat categories, related 
target audiences, as well as an illustrative list of target 
behaviors for each. When designing behavior change 
interventions, it is important to be specific in the audience 
and the behavior we aim to address: each will be driven by 
a unique set of motivations, attitudes, knowledge, values, 
and barriers. Any one of the target behaviors listed below 
could, in practice, be further expanded to identify multiple 
contributory ‘micro behaviors,’ each deserving its own 
focus.

1.3 WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?
There are many potential tools to address the threats 
listed above. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) 
might traditionally use awareness-raising and education to 
garner support for conservation, while policy-makers can 
legislate new economic incentives or environmental laws, 
standards, and protections. In the next chapter we explain 
the behavioral science behind these approaches and show that they can be highly effective under the right conditions. 
But the same science shows us that they also suffer from 
a number of limitations, resting on flawed assumptions 
about human behavior. 
In subsequent chapters we draw on insights from 
behavioral economics and social and cognitive psychology 
(collectively known as behavioral science) and demonstrate 
how to apply these insights to improve the design of

IS INDIVIDUAL ACTION ENOUGH?  
THE VALUE OF TARGETING 
BUSINESSES AND MARKETS
When defining our target behaviors, it is important to identity the key ‘pressure points’ which have the biggest 
impact on the systems of production and consumption that degrade our planet. Often, this leads us to consider 
not just the action of individuals, but also of firms, or even the functioning of markets themselves. In the UK, 
the recently introduced sugar tax is a perfect example of these dynamics: two tax thresholds were imposed 
at two levels of sugar content in drinks, but unlike a conventional ‘sin tax’— i.e., one that penalizes undesirable 
behavior in order to discourage it — this tax was not based on incentivizing consumers to switch drinks in order 
to achieve particular health guidelines on sugar intake. Rather, they enabled suppliers to quite feasibly re-
formulate their products to avoid the tax. As a result, even though only a small fraction of consumers would have 
switched products in response to the higher prices, driving reformulation caused all customers to benefit from 
drinking less sugar, without paying more or having to move away from their preferred brand. This results in a far 
more effective and less regressive tax, particularly where the behavior being targeted is rooted in habit or even 
sugar addiction, and thus difficult to shift at the level of consumers. When applying the strategies in this report, 
we must similarly consider whether we can best achieve our goals by shifting the behavior of consumers or 
suppliers and markets.
We must also acknowledge that markets are built upon the interactions of suppliers, regulators, and consumers – 
all human, and so all shaped by the biases, emotions, and other behavioral patterns described in the subsequent 
chapters. Recognizing and correcting for behavioral market failures is therefore just as valid a strategy (and often 
an extension of) nudging individual consumers.22 For example, energy consumers tend to be ‘sticky,’ since status 
quo bias, risk aversion, and procrastination lead us to stick with our existing energy tariff, even when it is patently 
bad value. Suppliers can use this human failing to their advantage through price gauging. Defaulting customers 
into a better deal, or otherwise using behavioral science to increase their engagement, is therefore not only 
a welfare-enhancing nudge for the individual consumer, but also a route to overcoming fundamental market 
failures leading to positive structural changes. In this case, nudging just a proportion of customers can force 
energy suppliers to be more competitive in their pricing, thus benefitting all consumers, whether engaged or not. 
The same principles could help us in a variety of conservation efforts. For instance, we might seek to nudge a 
fraction of consumers away from unsustainably farmed produce – an achievement in itself, but with the real prize 
being a shift in suppliers’ behavior who must now pay more attention to the sustainability of their practices to 
avoid losing market share. These ‘double nudges’ can be powerful routes to more widespread change.
So, when reading the following chapters, we urge you to hold these ideas in mind. Often what looks like an 
individual nudge or incentive can equally be used to shift business behavior or to fundamentally tip the incentives 
in a way that leads to widespread market reform.
campaigns, community interventions, financial incentives, 
and policy reforms. In taking a holistic approach to human 
behavior we highlight the importance of conscious as well 
as non-conscious behavior; the importance of individuals 
as well as social groups; and the importance of people’s choices and also the physical, cultural, and economic 
context. Chapter 3 offers 15 strategies to encourage 
environmental change using behavioral science and 
Chapter 4 shows how we can apply them.

2. SHINING THE SPOTLIGHT  
ON CONVENTIONAL WISDOM
For the most part, current efforts to enforce or promote 
conservation behaviors are built on a ‘rational’ account 
of human behavior. This perspective emphasizes the 
role of conscious and deliberative decision-making, 
suggesting we trade off costs and benefits in an effort 
to maximize our self-interests according to our personal 
values and preferences.23 This account of human nature 
is formalized in micro- and macro-economic models, and 
thus dominates the policymaker’s toolkit. Specifically, 
environmental laws and agreements like CITES, and 
incentives such as taxes or payments for eco-services, 
all leverage rational self-interest by making the ‘good’ 
behavior more appealing or less punishing than the ‘bad’ 
as to maximize personal benefits and minimize costs. 
Meanwhile tools of information provision (including 
education, products labels, or awareness-raising) 
recognize that rational decision-makers can only act on the 
knowledge they possess. 
Conservation NGOs tend to focus on our beliefs, 
awareness, and attitudes as drivers of our behavior. 
The common assumption here is that if people only 
knew of the damage their actions caused (awareness), 
or if they cared a little more (attitudes and values), they 
would change their behavior. This approach is therefore 
synonymous with a rational account of behavior, since it 
implies that intentional behavior flows from a conscious 
appraisal of our beliefs, values, and preferences.
These conventional tools of policy and campaigning 
have merit, and in some cases can be profoundly 
effective. For instance, knowledge and awareness can 
be a necessary step to making a conscious decision 
to be more sustainable. It is plausible, for example, 
that many consumers of tiger wine are unaware of the 
severe depletion of Asian tigers in recent years, and 
this knowledge may be enough to shift their actions. 
However, this would be the exception rather than the 
rule. More typically, the evidence overwhelmingly shows 
that information alone is a weak route to behavior change; 
other barriers such as conflicting motives, hassle, ingrained 
habit, social norms, or non-conscious drivers of our 
behavior tend to dominate.24
Similarly, it is often true that our behavior reflects a strong 
degree of self-interest, and so incentives and bans that 
leverage reward or punishment can work well. But we also 
know they can be ineffective or even counter-productive. 
For instance, payments for ecosystem-services or other 
pro-social behaviors can crowd-out intrinsic motivations 
and undermine conservation efforts.25 Fines can be 
construed as a price, and thus license people to continue the undesirable behavior, guilt-free.26, 27 Outright bans 
can also fail to achieve their goals, particularly where the 
banned practice is well established, hidden or difficult 
to enforce, strongly motivated, and where the switch to 
alternatives is difficult, costly, or unappealing. It is for all 
of these reasons that attempts to ban alcohol have tended 
to fail. They urge caution in relying on bans to solve our 
conservation threats, such as over-fishing among coastal 
communities, the illegal consumption of tiger bone, or 
human-wildlife conflict. Each of these practices is difficult 
to monitor and rooted in powerful motives for safety, 
subsistence, or profit. Behavioral insights can help us 
understand these challenges.
Powerful as they are, conventional tools are evidently not 
a panacea. We should therefore use these tools where we 
can and where they’ll be effective, and we also need to 
augment them with a deeper, more realistic understanding 
of the drivers of human behavior. In particular, we want to 
highlight three insights from behavioral science that we 
think add most value to the conservationist’s toolkit.
Insight 1:  
We must focus more on non-conscious 
decision-making processes
Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman characterizes human 
cognition as having two parallel processes. One is slow, 
reflective, and cognizant, and most resembles what we 
think of as ‘rational choice.’ Although bounded by limited 
information and finite cognitive bandwidth, it describes 
our ability to make deliberative and intentional decisions. 
The other system is rapid, largely automatic, and driven 
by intuitive processes including habit, social influence, 
emotion, and the use of conscious and non-conscious 
heuristics (mental shortcuts or rules of thumb).28 We are 
bombarded with stimuli and make many thousands of 
decisions each day, and so we have evolved to prioritize 
cognitive efficiency, relying heavily on these ‘fast and 
frugal’ processes. Despite our relative unawareness of this 
fact, they underpin the majority of our daily decisions and 
actions, and thus shape our lives profoundly.29
Though these mental shortcuts help us make good 
decisions with minimal thought or effort, they also render 
us susceptible to systematic bias of judgment. These are 
deviations from strictly ‘rational’ logic – albeit often rooted 
in sound evolutionary instincts30 – which lead to predictable 
patterns of decision-making.31 For example, we predictably 
err towards the familiar and the status quo;32 we feel 
losses more severely than equivalent gains;33 we are highly 
averse to risks;34 we blindly follow the crowd and adopt

their norms;35 and we follow simple, routine rules of thumb 
like ‘choose the middle option’ or ‘rule-out the options I’ve 
not heard of.’36
As behavior-change practitioners, we need to reflect these 
decision-making processes in our policies and campaigns: 
harnessing or addressing cognitive bias; understanding 
the mental short-cuts and social influences that dominate 
our thinking; finding was to shift ingrained habits; and 
effectively leveraging emotion. These themes emerge 
throughout the strategies in the next chapter.
Insight 2:  
We must focus more on the setting of  
our behavior
Another consequence of our reliance on automatic 
thinking and simple heuristics is that these are often 
routine responses to cues in our social and physical 
environment. The characteristics of our environment 
therefore greatly influence our actions. This is highlighted 
by social psychology and behavioral economics, which 
reveal the profound power of social influence (the actions 
and expectations of our peers and our culture) and of 
the choice architecture (the manner in which choices are 
framed and presented).37, 38 The importance of context 
and environment is emphasized even more strongly by 
sociological accounts which move the locus of behavior 
away from individuals altogether, putting society itself 
center-stage.39,40 This re-gears the issue away from 
individuals’ good or bad choices towards good or bad 
societal structures, both at the small scale (social and 
material setting) and the large (corporate, economic, 
cultural, and political forces).
Evidence suggests this outward focus has merit. 
Interventions that manipulate the social and physical 
setting of behavior (e.g., by changing pricing, default 
outcomes, availability, convenience, perceived social 
norms, and the physical environment) have often been 
found to be more effective than those that target ‘internal’ 
motives such as attitudes and awareness.41 As behavior-
change practitioners in conservation, there is enormous 
potential to introduce these techniques to our toolkit. We 
do this in the next chapter, with many strategies aiming to 
leverage the influence of our social environment, and of 
our physical or material environment. In practice, this often 
extends beyond the scope of a conventional awareness or 
social marketing campaign and demands collaboration with 
those who have control over our choice environments, 
namely governments, supermarkets, businesses, 
manufacturers, and so on. Insight 3:  
We must focus more on behavior, distinct  
from awareness, attitudes, or intentions
Conservation campaigns typically attempt to raise 
awareness and elevate pro-wildlife values, on the 
premise that awareness and values drive behavior. 
However, evidence of a prevalent value-action gap 
suggests otherwise.42 This evidence shows clearly that 
pro-environmental awareness and attitudes can lead 
us to adopt the easiest behaviors (such as recycling), 
but it’s another matter to significantly compromise 
our convenience, enjoyment, or profit in the name of 
sustainability.43, 44 In other words, we tend to do just 
enough to buttress our sense of integrity and allay our 
guilt, but otherwise rationalize our actions through various 
psychological defenses such as moral licensing45 (using 
one good act to justify the bad) and motivated reasoning 
or avoidance (reasoning towards a self-serving conclusion, 
or simply not thinking about it).46, 47 These barriers may 
be particularly potent when we don’t like the solution: if 
we are facing new restrictions on our fishing or logging 
practices we’d rather not see happen, we are more 
motivated to deny the validity of the problem.48 Moreover, 
even the most sincere aspirations to act more sustainably 
are often thwarted by practical and psychological barriers, 
including lack of know-how, forgetfulness, procrastination, 
ingrained habit, lack of self-efficacy, limited willpower, 
upfront cost, poor availability, or seemingly trivial frictions 
and hassles that disproportionately inhibit action.
For instance, one study shows that a 7-year suite of 
conservation interventions around a Ugandan national 
park (including conflict reduction, education, community 
resource access, and support for community development) 
managed to successfully build an understanding of 
the conservation agenda and shift attitudes within the 
community. However, behavior did not materially change, 
with poaching and illegal grazing still widespread. The 
researchers conclude that “attitudes and awareness 
are not adequate predictors of conservation behavior.”49 
Similarly, researchers have found that ecotourism can 
help engender pro-conservation attitudes among local 
villagers (in one study’s case, with respect to leatherback 
turtles), but turtle hunting remained common.50 In the 
case of the wildlife trade in Asia, researchers conclude the 
link between information provision and behavior change 
“is tenuous at best.”51 These kinds of findings are very 
common in sustainable behavior-change research where 
actual behavior is measured.52
We therefore need to be more realistic about what 
actually drives behavior and recognize the weak 
connection between our values, attitudes, and actions. 
A more pragmatic approach is partly about harnessing

the right motives – it can be naïve to use a message 
of wildlife conservation to compete with motives for 
profit, convenience, or pleasure, particularly among an 
audience whose livelihoods depend on the behaviors 
we are trying to change. It is also partly about helping 
people overcome barriers of inconvenience, forgetfulness, 
procrastination, etc., so that they can act on the good 
intentions they already have. It is also about finding 
alternative routes to behavior that don’t rely on pro-wildlife 
attitudes, for instance through non-conscious drivers, 
social influence, or the physical environment (as discussed 
above). But perhaps an even more critical lesson is one of 
measurement: our behavior can be diametrically opposed 
to our stated attitudes or intentions, so we need to define 
the success of conservation efforts around behaviors, 
not attitudes. This requires better research and evaluation 
tools, which we discuss in Chapter 4 and Annex B.
None of this is to say that raising awareness and targeting 
public attitudes is pointless. Some individuals may shift 
their behavior through increased awareness alone, while 
some interventions (e.g., symbolic taxes, such as on plastic 
bags) tend to work better when consumers understand 
and support their goal. Moreover, public awareness is 
often a critical step towards public acceptance and support 
of major policy changes such as the creation of protected area, which brings real impact. However, we must be 
realistic about the limited extent to which awareness and 
attitude-change is a direct and effective route to behavior-
change.
2.2 COMPLETING THE TOOLKIT
The key message is not that conventional thinking — 
using regulations, incentives, and information campaigns 
—is always wrong. Rather, that it is incomplete, and 
depends upon several assumptions that are flawed. We 
therefore need a more holistic set of tools that reflect 
these three key insights. We need tools which recognize 
the conscious and non-conscious processes of decision-
making, including habit, emotion, social influence, and our 
use of heuristics and susceptibility to bias. We need tools 
that recognize the extent to which our social and material 
environments profoundly influence us. And we need tools 
that target behavior, not just attitudes or beliefs.
In the following chapter we present concrete strategies 
rooted in successful case studies from the fields of 
conservation, sustainability, and beyond.

3. STRATEGIES FOR APPLYING BEHAVIORAL 
SCIENCE TO CONSERVATION
Having explored the limitations of a conventional approach 
to behavior change in the conservation field, we now 
present a more holistic set of tools that draw on our 
current knowledge and findings of human behavior and 
motivation, and provide guidelines for their application in 
the field. In developing this toolkit, three clear categories 
of strategies emerged, which reflect the three profound 
drivers of human behavior. One is to motivate the change. 
This includes harnessing our target audiences’ personal 
values and interests, using conventional incentives in 
ways that are more behaviorally informed, and effectively 
leveraging emotions and cognitive biases. Another 
category is to socialize the change. We are fundamentally 
a social species, with much of our behavior determined 
by social norms, the expectations and actions of our 
peers, and the social identities we ascribe to ourselves 
and to others. The third category is to ease the change. 
This includes removing frictions and hassles where 
possible, helping people plan and act on their intentions, 
finding timely moments at which change is easiest, and building an environment that enables and supports the 
desired behavior. It is important to note that these are 
not direct replacements for, or necessarily better than, 
the conventional tools discussed in the previous chapter. 
Their value is as a suite of alternatives, best used when 
conventional tools are either unlikely to be the most 
effective strategy, or impossible to enact or to enforce (and 
thus where we rely more heavily on voluntary behavior-
change). They might also be used in addition to legislation, 
incentives, or education, or indeed provide a new lens 
through which to look at these conventional tools, where 
each is improved by a better understanding of behavioral 
science. Often, it is a combination of approaches that 
yields the best results.
For each of the 15 strategies in this chapter, we draw on 
successful case studies across a wide range of contexts, 
and share ideas for how they could be translated to the 
conservation challenges summarized in Chapter 1.
MOTIVATE THE CHANGE
1. Leverage positive emotions
2. Frame messaging to personal values, identities, or interests
3. Personalize and humanize messages
4. Harness cognitive biases
5. Design behaviorally-informed incentives
SOCIALIZE THE CHANGE
6. Promote the desirable norm
7. Harness reciprocity
8. Increase behavioral observability and accountability
9. Encourage public and peer-to-peer commitments
10. Choose the right messenger
EASE THE CHANGE
11. Make it easy by removing frictions and promoting substitutes
12. Provide support with planning and implementation of intentions
13. Simplify messages and decisions
14. Alter the choice setting
15. Use timely moments, prompts, and reminders

The Ethics of Behavior Change
Behavior change practitioners seeking to realize a social good 
must pay attention to ethics, as ethics are particularly relevant 
to a program that uses persuasion to influence a target 
audience and achieve its goals. Therefore, we encourage 
practitioners to adhere to the following three principles:53
Principle of well-being 
Particular intervention strategies may target different kinds 
of well-being, and we cannot expect all forms of well-being 
to be equally pursued at all times. Even so, following the 
principle of well-being means that our work should always 
entail the goal of helping humans and nature flourish. 
Principle of integrity 
At no time should conservation advocates misrepresent 
facts or people’s ideas, even if they do not agree with 
them. Nor should advocates misrepresent the intentions 
and consequences of particular environmental policies or 
instances of management. Finally, conversation practitioners 
should not deceive or manipulate people in ways that cause 
them to do behavior they do not want to do or removes their 
agency or free will.
 Principle of empowerment 
Whenever possible, behavior change interventions should 
empower citizens to make democratic decisions about 
conservation, such as through environmental policy and 
management. To do this, interventions should strive to make 
the best scientific, political, economic, and moral arguments 
available to the public.
There is a rich body of literature on the ethics of behavior 
change, and nudging strategies in particular, which often 
embrace non-conscious forms of influence. We cannot do 
this literature justice here and direct interested readers to 
resources such as Cass Sunstein’s The Ethics of Influence. 
Such literature demonstrates how behavioral science sheds 
new light on the nature of agency and of personal choice. 
In practice, influence in unavoidable, as we are constantly 
being nudged towards certain choices by aspects of our 
environment, whether done with intent or not. The ethical 
influencer, therefore, seeks to ensure their influence is 
for good rather than for profit or personal agenda; that 
their influence leads to improved decisions on the target 
audience’s own terms; and freedom of choice is not 
restricted, unless justified to reduce harms committed to 
others (as with restricted freedoms through environmental 
laws, for example). We encourage you to explore what ethical 
influence means to you in your work and use our principles as 
helpful guidelines.

Strategy 10:  
Choose the right messenger
Whose advice would you rather follow? 
The University of Delaware (UD) and Rare partnered on an experiment where students 
role-played as factory owners who had to make decisions about production activities that 
could result in local stream pollution. Some students interacted with a UD mascot and 
others with a Rare mascot, and each mascot would react to students’ decisions. Students 
who were paired with the UD mascot were 75 percent more likely to achieve the clean 
water goals compared to the Rare mascot, showing the importance of in-group identity.145
What is the strategy? 
Identify who (or which organization or branding) will be most influential in promoting a certain message, product, or practice. 
We generally respond to people of authority, and those with whom we identify. First, by ‘authority,’ we refer to those with 
credibility (e.g., experts or those who have adopted the behavior themselves), or those with some degree of power over 
us (including government, local leaders and parents, children). Second, we care about those with whom we identify, which 
typically includes our peers (who are relatable and trustworthy), or indeed celebrities (who we admire). 
Why does it work? 
Social identity theory highlights just how important social identity is: we adopt the norms and practices of our perceived ‘in 
group’ but often refute those of our ‘out group.’146 This means that our peers, or converted individuals who used to be ‘just 
like us,’ are both relatable and credible. Social influence more broadly shows we are more likely to internalize the claims or 
opinions of those perceived as credible, and to comply with those of perceived legitimate authority.147 Trust is also key, and 
we are more likely to trust our neighbor or general practitioner than we are to trust our government or a foreign organization 
meddling in our community. We are also more likely to present a good persona of ourselves to certain people, such as our 
own children, a religious leader, or our boss. Used effectively, these people can therefore have a stronger effect on our 
actions than generic or psychologically ‘distant’ messengers (such as a national government or a foreign NGO). The use of 
celebrities – common among environmental NGOs – can be effective partly because they simply increase the exposure of 
the message itself, but it is important that in order for the message to resonate with the audience, the celebrity must also be 
credible, trustworthy, likeable, and relatable.
Learn about other success stories: 
• In a study where parents served as environmental role models, their children adopted more pro-environmental behavior.148
• A study of Costa Rican children who were in an environmental education course showed that parents’ knowledge of 
conservation increased after one month as compared to a control group of adults whose children were not part of the 
education course.149
• BIT found that energy companies are more effective messengers to get their own customers to switch suppliers than 
the energy market regulator Ofgem, because of trusted relationships and the clear lack of ulterior motive in one supplier 
promoting its competitors.150

3.3 EASE THE CHANGE
There is a direct relationship between our motivation to do 
something and the ease of doing it: the less motivated we 
are, the easier it must be for us to take action; the harder 
it is to do, the more motivation we must have to do it. This 
is particularly important when it comes to conservation 
and other pro-environmental behaviors, since we know 
that motivation is often low, or at least in conflict with 
other motives such as for pleasure or profit. It is therefore 
critical that we make the desirable behaviors as easy as 
possible. There are various ways of achieving this, some 
by supporting and encouraging the individual, and some by 
shaping the environment around them to ease the change.
In Chapter 2 we introduced the idea of limited cognitive 
bandwidth. We often grapple with too much information, 
too little time, uncertainty over options, and complexity in 
reaching a distant goal. Willpower, forgetfulness, know-
how, and procrastination further impede our ability to 
act on our good intentions. Helping people with these 
decisions, with making plans, and with implementing 
their intentions, is therefore a valuable approach. This is 
particularly true where the target behavior is complex or 
multi-faceted, such as adopting new agricultural practices, 
or when we risk defaulting to a ‘hot’ or impulsive response, 
such as in human-wildlife conflict. In these situations, 
using behavioral science to help our target audience 
develop plans and strategies can help, as can the simple 
use of prompts, reminders, feedback, and deadlines to 
overcome procrastination or forgetfulness. 
It is also useful to think about the timeliness of a target 
behavior. We are much more likely to change our behavior 
at certain moments, such as moments of disruption or 
natural decision points where the status quo is disrupted. 
This is partly because old habits have been paused (for 
example, we might start cycling to work when we move 
jobs), and partly because hassle is temporarily removed 
(for example, we are more likely to install attic insulation 
when we have just moved homes, while the attic is empty 
and we’re doing renovations anyway). There is therefore 
great value in identifying the timeliest moments to 
intervene to encourage behavior-change.Substitutes also provide a powerful tool: when an action 
is rooted in ingrained habit, or driven by powerful motives 
that are difficult to overcome, it is often easier to transplant 
those desires onto a substitute behavior than to curtail 
them altogether. This is a strategy that has recently 
attracted attention in the conservation community working 
to tackle the illegal wildlife trade.156 However, promoting 
viable substitutes is not straightforward. For instance, 
there are concerns that efforts to promote synthetic 
alternatives to wildlife products such as rhino horn 
may have backfired, since demand for the real product 
may have increased in response to sellers promoting 
its authenticity.157 More research is needed, but it is 
probable that the important feature of substitutes is not 
that they have superficial similarity to the original product 
or behavior, but that they satisfy the same fundamental 
motivations and desires and renders the original behavior 
unnecessary. For instance, substituting beef for chicken 
has significant environmental benefit, and is likely to be 
easier for meat-eaters than going meat-free. Meanwhile, 
several food tech companies, such as Impossible Burger, 
are working to create plant-based products that offer 
hyper-realistic alternative to beef that even ‘bleed.’ In 
the context of illegal gifting of wildlife products, the 
motivations are variously rooted in status and exclusivity, 
currying favor, generosity, artistic value, memorability, 
and so on. As such, sustainable but synthetic versions of 
the same product may be seen as an inferior alternative 
on all these metrics. Instead, substitute gifting practices 
that evoke the same notions of luxury and status would be 
more likely to be effective. 
One of the most powerful ways we can support an 
individual to change their behavior is to change the 
structure of their environment or the framing of the 
choices presented to them. As discussed in Chapter 2, 
our choices and our actions are as much a function of the 
physical ‘choice environment’ as they are of our ‘inner’ 
motives and cognitive processes. Recent research in 
behavioral economics has shown the power of altering the 
setting to smooth to journey towards the desired behavior. 
Sometimes this is as simple as removing ‘frictions costs’ 
and hassle factors in bureaucratic processes (or indeed add

Strategy 12:  
Provide support with planning and 
implementation intentions
Would planning motivate you to recycle more at work? 
A tele-company in the Netherlands wanted to reduce its environmental impact through 
employees recycling more paper and plastic. They conducted an experiment to compare 
the effectiveness of offering recycling bins and the opportunity to form implementation 
intentions to recycle. For employees who spent time planning out their recycling 
intentions, waste going to landfill decreased by 75-80 percent as compared to employees 
who did not make a plan, and this behavior persisted in the months following the 
intervention.166
 
What is the strategy?
Implementation intentions are a specific type of planning tool that specify when, where, and how a person intends to 
complete a goal, giving them a premeditated strategy for overcoming likely barriers. Providing timely feedback can also help 
people track and validate their progress to maintain motivation and help re-direct efforts.
Why does it work? 
Studies find that only about half of people successfully act on their intentions and potentially achieve subsequent 
goals.167 There are many reasons for this ‘intention-action gap,’168 including daily distractions, conflicting intentions, or 
small hassle factors (e.g., having to rinse a yogurt cup before being able to recycle it). These can be disproportionately 
discouraging and keep people from acting on their intentions (e.g., to recycle more). We also systematically overestimate 
our future performance, or the likelihood that good things will happen to us, and in turn underestimate adverse events.169 
Implementation intention prompts ask people to note down, or at least consider, when, where, and how they will follow-
up on their intention and thereby create a concrete association between a feeling or intention in the present and the 
consequential behavior in the future.170 In addition to making a plan, having a way to obtain feedback can be useful for 
tracking and feeling rewarded for progress, and comparing how you’re doing compared to others.171
Learn about more success stories:
• BIT ran a pilot with the Department for Work and Pensions and JobCentre Plus in Essex and found the usage of 
implementation intentions in searching for work opportunities significantly increased employment outcomes.172
• When motivating free flu vaccinations, researchers found that when individuals were prompted to write down the date 
and time of their appointment, they were more likely to get vaccinated.173
• When individuals used smart-meters to provide real-time feedback about their water consumption in the shower, their 
water use decreased 22 percent.174

4. FROM THEORY TO PRACTICE: APPLYING 
BEHAVIORAL INSIGHTS TO REAL-WORLD 
CONSERVATION CASES  
 
OVERVIEW OF THE TWO METHODOLOGIES
BIT: A typical project at BIT has five components, and together we refer to this as the TESTS methodology. Each stage builds 
on the previous, though it is also iterative. The five stages are as follows:
Phase What Why
 Target Step 1: Translate project objectives into 
behavioral objectives
Step 2: Prioritize the target behavior(s) and 
make it SMARTProgram objectives are often broad or stated in 
terms of conservation outcomes. We first need 
to identify the specific behaviors we need to 
influence.
 Explore Step 3: Map out the user journey and 
identify relevant touchpoints
Step 4: Identify barriers and driversWe aim to understand the drivers and barriers 
of the target behavior, the surrounding context 
in which it occurs (and within which we must 
operate), and the possible touch-points at which to 
intervene.
SolutionStep 5: Ideate interventions
Step 6: Prioritize and refineOur interventions should a) be rooted in an 
understanding of behavioral science, b) reflect 
the dominant barriers and drivers, and c) make 
the most of available touch-points with the target 
audience.
 TrialStep 7: Develop research and evaluation 
strategy
Step 8: Implement strategy and analyze dataHuman behavior is complex and unpredictable, 
so we focus strongly on the rigor of evaluation, to 
find out if (as well as why, how, and for whom) the 
interventions work. 
 ScaleStep 9: Scale successful interventions Where interventions are successful, and where the 
evidence meets high standards, we seek to scale 
them and spread best practice.
With all of the previous behavioral strategies in mind, it’s 
time to put them into action. In this chapter we illustrate 
BIT’s and Rare’s methodologies to delivering behavior 
change projects. BIT and Rare work in similar ways, but 
each has a slightly different focus, which is rooted in the strengths and histories of each organization. In this chapter, 
BIT and Rare share their insights as well as how they 
would approach real-world cases of illegal wildlife trade and 
overfishing, including how the strategies from Chapter 3 
might be applied.

Rare: We typically follow eight steps in our projects. Our methodology is called ‘Behavior-Centered Design’ (BCD), as it 
blends insights and approaches from behavioral science and design thinking. While the steps appear linear, like BIT, we also 
encourage circling back to a prior step, such as to gather more data or generate more solutions. Self-evaluation is critical 
throughout. 
Step What Why
Frame  Frame the conservation challenge to 
understand the target behavior, target 
audience, and describe their context.To focus your efforts on behaviors and audiences 
that will have a meaningful impact on your 
conservation goals.
Empathize Gain deep insights about the target 
audience’s relationship with the target 
behavior, including their motivations and 
challenges.Successful interventions depend on your ability to 
reach people in ways that are meaningful to them.
Map   Organize insights about your target 
audience into behavioral motivations and 
challenges.Developing a holistic hypothesis about your 
target audience’s behaviors will lead to more 
effective interventions.
Ideate    Generate, group, and prioritize 
intervention ideas.You have many creative ideas and limited time and 
resources! This step will help you decide among 
your interventions to choose the best one to pilot.
PrototypeSelect your best intervention idea and 
develop a prototype (small-scale version) 
that captures its essential features.By creating a small-scale version of your 
intervention, you can experiment and estimate its 
success without investing a lot of resources.
Test     Test your prototype with your target 
audience and make revisions based 
on their feedback and your own 
experience.Before launching your intervention at scale, it’s 
valuable to gain feedback from a few members 
of your target audience.
Launch  Plan and launch your full-scale 
intervention and think about evaluation 
and impact metrics.This is your big moment! Use this step to launch 
your intervention and prepare for how you will 
measure it in the next step.
Assess   Assess the impact of your intervention 
and reflect on potential improvements.This step helps us know if behavior change is 
happening and to what degree, so we can share 
our success and findings with the world!
The two approaches share similarities.  
What are their respective strengths?
BIT: Being founded within the UK prime minister’s office, 
BIT has historically been immersed in the world of policy. 
We take a rigorous approach to applying behavioral insights 
to the design of policy instruments, communications, 
public service design, and bureaucratic process. We’ve 
also been at the forefront of evidence-based policy-
making, having undertaken more Randomized Controlled 
Trials than the rest of the UK government combined. 
Our portfolio of work has since expanded well beyond 
government (working internationally with NGOs, private 
firms, and government ministries), but we’ve maintained a focus on evidence and rigorous evaluation (see Annex B 
for details on our approach to impact evaluations). 
Rare: As a conservation organization working with local 
communities around the world, we have a particular focus 
on co-creation with our partners. That means we spend 
significant time in the field to immerse ourselves in the 
local experience and learn about community members’ 
day-to-day lives. Qualitative research and co-designing 
solutions with community members thereby become 
integral to developing the right behavior change strategy. 
It’s this collaborative and hands-on approach that we’re 
known for.

APPLICATIONS TO REAL WORLD 
CONSERVATION CASES
How might BIT think about addressing the 
illegal consumption of tiger products?
BIT: Most of our projects are collaborative with one 
or more delivery partners – such as a government 
department, NGO or other organizations ‘on the ground’ 
who act as point of access to the target audience. Different 
organizations have different levers they can pull – for 
instance an NGO might be restricted to media campaign 
interventions, whilst a local government department, or a 
large firm, or a national park authority, will all have different 
points of influence over the target audience. In this case 
let’s imagine we’re working with an NGO in the China/
Mekong region, with some scope to collaborate with local 
businesses or other organizations.Target
Step 1: Translate project objectives to 
behavioral objectives
The first task is to unpack the overarching project 
goals into discrete target behaviors: specifically what 
actions, and among whom, do we want to influence? 
The consumption of tiger products captures myriad 
motivations, contexts, target audiences, and types of 
behavior. When designing interventions, each of these 
might deserve its own tailored approach. It’s therefore 
helpful to be as specific as possible, and one approach to 
this is to start by defining all the discrete ‘micro behaviors’ 
that contribute to the larger problem. Sometimes this might 
need a formal Theory of Change, modeling the steps and 
mechanisms through which the behavior arises. A simpler 
approach is to categorize the contributory behaviors, such as 
in the diagram shown in Figure 2.

Criteria General considerations In the case of illegal consumption of  
tiger products….
Target 
audienceAcross a large population, there will typically 
be a minority who are almost impossible to 
change. Ideally, we want to identify a large 
cohort who is less committed to their habits 
and who might be responsive to nudges and 
other, non-legislative interventions.Tourist purchases may be less pre-meditated, and thus easier to 
influence. There is also a large demographic of Chinese tourists 
who are easily targeted (through the right collaborations) since 
they tend to use tour operators offering packaged trips with set 
itineraries and schedules.
In contrast, medicinal purchases may be more rooted in tradition, 
emotion or desperation, whilst investors, gifters, and bribers will be 
more reasoned and calculated. 
Feasibility Several dimensions of feasibility must be 
considered: Are there political barriers? 
What kinds of behavioral interventions might 
we need in order to have an impact, and are 
they practically achievable? Do we hold the 
levers required to implement the kinds of 
interventions necessary and collect data, or 
would we need to collaborate with another 
organizations? Are there cost limitations?In this case our partner NGO has good local contacts and expertise, 
but no direct ‘implementation power,’ since they don’t control the 
systems or touch-points through which people are buying tiger 
products. We can therefore run mass-media campaigns, but it’s 
likely to be more impactful if we can collaborate with others. We’d 
presume that working with Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) 
providers might be more difficult than working with tour operators, 
airlines, or businesses, for example, perhaps leading us to focus 
more on business gifting and bribing, and touristic purchases. 
Potential 
impactWe aim to prioritize our efforts towards 
specific elements of the problem where 
most impact can be had. This depends on 
two factors 1 - to what extent is the target 
behavior impacting wildlife? And 2 - to what 
extent might we be able to shift this target 
behavior?We’d look to our partner’s expertise to understand which behaviors 
are most impactful and share our own expertise on which behaviors 
might more easily be influenced. This is partly down to extensive 
experience and expertise in behavioral science, but also built on the 
available evidence and data, which is why the next step (Explore) 
is often iterative with this step. In this instance, the consumption 
of TCM products and tiger wine might be higher impact, but less 
easily influenced, as with non-financial bribes too. Again, business-
gifting, and touristic purchases emerge as both significant in the 
impact on wildlife, but also more feasible to address through the 
local connections we have.
Data and 
measurementIt is important to establish upfront that 
you can (or already do) collect data on the 
behavioral outcome of interest. Whilst data 
should not be the primary determinant of 
our conservation efforts, it is reasonable to 
‘follow the data’ to some extent and focus 
more towards behaviors we can actually 
measure.Many of the behaviors we are interested in are illegal, and so are 
difficult to measure. Survey methods exist to yield more honest 
responses (such as unmatched count techniques), but we’d still 
need a way of implementing the survey in a controlled manner. 
Other sources of data, such as seizure rates on borders, also exist. 
Again, this decision depends largely on the potential to collaborate 
with the right partners and potential they have to observe or 
measure the target audience’s behavior. Once again, working 
with firms, tour operators, or airlines leads us towards touristic 
purchases or business-gifting.Step 2: Prioritize the target behavior(s), and make it 
SMART
We can’t expect to succeed in tackling all of these 
issues with a single intervention or campaign. Rather, we 
embrace an approach of ‘radical incrementalism,’ focusing 
on discrete elements of the problem. This reflects the fact that multiple tailored interventions each generating small 
improvements add up to a substantive impact and can 
often be more effective than generic campaigns seeking 
to increase awareness or concern for tigers generally. Our 
next step is therefore to prioritize these target behaviors, 
typically on the criteria outlined below:

Explore
We then move on to the second phase, 
Explore. The purpose here is to understand 
the target audience; their motivations, drivers, and barriers; 
relevant features of the context in which they are acting; 
and the various touch-points and opportunities we have 
for intervention. This lays the groundwork for developing a 
realistic, impactful solution.Step 3: Map out the user journey and identify relevant 
touchpoints
In order to understand the context and the processes 
within which our target behavior arises, we typically 
undertake a customer journey mapping exercise. This both 
illuminates the constraints of the systems we must operate 
in, and also identifies touchpoints (i.e., moments and 
connections through which we can intervene and elements 
of the process we might consider changing). In the case 
of Chinese tourists buying tiger tooth amulets in South-
East Asia whilst on a package holiday, a typical customer 
journey might be as follows in Figure 3.

Step 4: Identify barriers and drivers
Next, we aim to identify the barriers, drivers, and 
motivations: why do people do what they do, and not 
do what we would like them to? What are the potential 
motivations and triggers we could harness? When 
identifying barriers there is often a valid distinction 
between psychological (e.g., emotions, motives, cognitive 
biases, norms) and practical (hassle, availability, cost). 
In answering these questions, we draw on a number of 
research tools:
• Existing literature:  what is already known from 
academic, government, and NGO research?
• Ethnography, surveys, interviews, and focus 
groups: engaging with the target audience through the 
appropriate qualitative and quantitative research tools. • Analysis of existing datasets:  this can define the 
main contours of the problem, identify patterns of 
relevant behavior over time, identify segments of our 
target audience who differ in prevalence of the behavior 
or other characteristics, or to identify correlational links 
between the behavior and other factors. 
• Audience segmentation:  This is sometimes helpful 
to tailor interventions to different circumstances and 
target segments accordingly. 
• Mapping out a theory of change: This helps ground 
our intervention designs within an understanding of 
why the behavior occurs and the psychological and 
practical steps which consumers go through when 
purchasing tiger products.
For example, in the case of touristic purchases of tiger 
amulets, the following kinds of drivers and barriers might 
emerge through research:Figure 3. Touchpoints to discourage illegal wildlife purchases along a tourist's decision journey

Barriers to address Potential drivers that could be harnessed
Structural:
• Economic incentives associated with investing or reselling
• Traders have networks that receive commission or profit, 
including guides, touts, temples, etc.
• Ease of access both in markets and online
• Increasing middle class wealth and purchasing power
 
Behavioral:
• Powerful messenger effect if monks or other respected 
individuals suggest it is OK
• High social pressure from touts and guides, and social 
norm of other tourists acting as a ‘social license’
• Spiritual motivation, particularly in the moment of temple 
visits
• Scarcity effects – ‘now or never’ effect whilst on holiday
• Cultural beliefs associating amulets with masculinity and 
protection (e.g. gifted to male relatives with dangerous 
jobs)Structural:
• The law is mostly aligned with the prevention of  
this behavior
• International pressure for governments to take action
 
Behavioral:
• Increasing secularization of society
• Hassle and worry associated with risk of taking the 
products over borders
• National pride
• Religious duty not to harm is at odds with this practice
Solution
Next, we aim to develop intervention ideas. 
These should be grounded in the insights 
from the Explore phase (addressing the major barriers, 
harnessing relevant motivations where possible, utilizing 
key touch-points), but also bring in what we know about 
the science of behavior change (e.g., from Chapter 3 of 
this report). There are various ways of approaching this, 
including running workshops, creative design sessions, or 
rapid prototyping. One typical BIT approach would be as 
follows:
Step 5: Ideate interventions
We brainstorm intervention ideas drawing upon a range of 
resources, including the behavioral strategies covered in 
Chapter 3 of this report, as well as our frameworks EAST195 
and MINDSPACE196.
Continuing with our hypothetical case, intervention ideas 
might include the following:
1. Promoting substitutes. Behaviors can often be 
substituted for less harmful behaviors provided they 
satisfy the same motivations – in this case with credible spiritual associations, exclusivity, and rareness. This 
would likely require collaboration with temples and 
spiritual leaders to demote the idea that tiger products 
have spiritual value, promoting the idea that it is the 
monk’s blessing, rather than the product itself, which 
matters. (Strategy 11)
2. Messaging using dynamic norms. Communicating the 
changing public attitudes against the consumption of 
tiger products can leverage our sensitivity to social 
influence. (Strategy 6)
3. Identifiable victim effects. By creating a recognizable 
persona for a tiger hunted for its teeth and claws, we 
might build greater empathy towards the species. 
(Strategy 3)
4. Incentivize engagement with campaign materials 
through a lottery or mandate. Working with Chinese 
tour operators, tourists may be required (or incentivized 
like through a lottery) to view behaviorally-informed 
campaign materials at the point of flight check-in. This 
also harnesses a timely moment. (Strategies 5 and 15)
5. Encourage pledges or commitments among tourists. 
When booking a holiday online, there could be a place to 
sign on to not purchase tiger products. Timely reminders 
(e.g., through SMS when the tourist departs) can remind 
them of this commitment. (Strategies 9 and 15)Figure 4. Our intervention impact-feasibility matrix.

Solution
Next, we aim to develop intervention ideas. 
These should be grounded in the insights 
from the Explore phase (addressing the major barriers,

the science of behavior change (e.g., from Chapter 3 of

including running workshops, creative design sessions, or 
rapid prototyping. One typical BIT approach would be as 
follows:
Step 5: Ideate interventions
We brainstorm intervention ideas drawing upon a range of 
resources, including the behavioral strategies covered in 
Chapter 3 of this report, as well as our frameworks EAST195 
and MINDSPACE196.
Continuing with our hypothetical case, intervention ideas 
might include the following:
1. Promoting substitutes. Behaviors can often be 
substituted for less harmful behaviors provided they 
satisfy the same motivations – in this case with credible Figure 4. Our intervention impact-feasibility matrix.Step 6: Prioritize and refine
Typically, we might come up with several dozen 
intervention ideas, and in the first instance, no idea is a bad 
idea. We then prioritize these ideas on likely impact and 
feasibility, ranking each idea from low-to-high, looking for 
intervention ideas, which are high in both (see Figure 4). 
This may be expanded to include other key considerations, 
such as cost, ease of evaluation, or public acceptability. 
Often, multiple ideas (i.e., strategies from Chapter 3) can 
be bundled into a broader ‘suite’ of interventions. For 
example, idea 5 might include the use of dynamic norm 
messaging (idea 2). It may also be possible to test multiple 
interventions to compare their impacts. This also means 
that individual strategies from Chapter 3 often can be 
combined into one, more comprehensive intervention. If 
this is appropriate, deciding which ones may fit together 
needs to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.
At this point it is also necessary to refine the idea and flesh 
it out in full detail, including designing the materials of the 
intervention (e.g., communications or new processes), and 
ascertaining how it will be delivered. Where possible this 
should be prototypes and ‘stress-tested.’ 
Trial 
The next stage is to evaluate the impact of 
the chosen intervention. Impact evaluations 
are often supplemented with process evaluations 
(understanding why and how an intervention worked). 
Step 7 & 8: Develop a research and evaluation 
strategy and implement.
This is perhaps the most important stage, because 
no matter how well-theorized our intervention, human 
behavior is complex, context-specific, difficult to change, and unpredictable. It is therefore vital we know what 
works. It is also an area where we need to improve in 
conservation by measuring behavior (not attitudes of 
self-reported intentions), and testing intervention through 
robust, controlled trials. We use various research tools. 
Often this includes a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT), in 
addition to quasi-experimental techniques, data science, 
laboratory experiments, and qualitative theory-based 
evaluations. In Annex B we provide further detail on robust 
approaches to impact evaluation.
Scale
Step 9: Scale successful interventions
The final stage of TESTS is about scaling up our 
intervention if it has been successful. In order to do this a 
number of factors need to be considered: 
Evidence:  Is the finding robust enough? Scientific rigor 
normally demands replication of findings, particularly in 
high-stakes contexts where getting it wrong at scale would 
be damaging. However limited resources, and the need to 
act fast, often demand a more pragmatic view on where 
the balance of evidence lies and whether the evidence 
of efficacy outweighs the risk. It may also be possible 
to continue to measure and evaluate as we scale up, for 
example undertaking a ‘step wedge’ trial.
Cost/benefit:  Was the intervention successful enough 
to justify the cost? Can the intervention be delivered in a 
more cost-efficient way at scale? 
Logistics:  Do we have effective delivery channels? Can 
we create them? Must we scale the intervention by 
repeating it one location at a time, or are there existing 
channels to do this en-masse, for example through 
professional bodies or authorities? Can we codify 
interventions for others to adopt, or develop best practice 
guides?
Fidelity:  Is it possible to maintain the fidelity of the 
intervention when delivering at scale? Or is there a risk that 
important detail will be lost as others adopt it?
Replicability:  Are we confident that we would observe 
the same results in other locations? Or do we think 
contextual differences require us to evaluate and validate 
the findings in each individual case?
Sponsorship:  How can we ensure buy-in from both 
leaders and frontline practitioners who were not involved in 
the initial trial, and who may need persuading of the value?
Accountability:  Do we have clear levers and reporting 
structures?X3X2

with exclusive access privileges for fishing in defined 
areas. They are positioned next to ‘no-take’ reserves where 
no fishing is allowed, promoting fish reproduction and 
‘spillover’ into fishing grounds.200
Tinambac, a municipality in the northern Luzon region of 
the Philippines, has a population of about 65,000 people, 
where the primary industries are fishing, farming, and 
seaweed farming. Around 1,000 registered fishers use the 
209 square kilometers of municipal waters, mostly in the 
region’s two bays, San Miguel and Lamit. In the 1990s and 
2000s, fishing pressure from local and industrial fishers in 
Tinambac became so great that the future sustainability of 
the municipality’s critical resource base was in dire straits. 
80-90 percent of local fishers used cyanide and dynamite 
to stun and kill fish, and it was common for locals to hear 
15-20 blasts a day. In 2010, a local NGO called Network 
of Sustainable Livelihoods Catalysts, Inc. (NSLC, Inc.) and 
founded by a young, enterprising local leader named Cathy 
Demesa, began partnering with Rare to promote a better 
path forward for Tinambac’s fishing industry. 
They focused on the following four key target behaviors:
1. Fishers become registered
2. Fishers participate in community-based management
3. Fishers record and use catch data for management 
decision-making
4. Fishers fish with the right gear in the right place at the 
right timeEmpathize
Before beginning to design any behavior-centered 
intervention to such a complex challenge, it is 
critical to gain deep insights about the target audience. In 
this case, we’ll focus on Tinambac fishers and the broader 
community of local citizens surrounding them, and their 
relationships, motivations and challenges. Successful 
efforts depend critically on the ability to ‘meet people 
where they are,’ reaching them in ways that are meaningful 
to them, not necessarily the intervention designer. This 
begins by deploying a mixed methods approach, including 
observation, interviews, focus groups, and questionnaire 
surveys in order to develop an empathetic lens through 
which to view the target audience.
Map
After gathering your data, it’s time to analyze 
and organize it in a way that helps to reveal key behavioral 
insights on which to base your intervention. Specifically, 
this step draws out and shows the relationships between 
the behavioral motivations and challenges related to your 
target behavior (i.e., where there is potential to motivate, 
socialize, or ease the change). Developing a holistic 
hypothesis about your target audience’s behavior will 
lead to more effective interventions. On the next page, 
we have provided an example of how we might translate 
our data observations into behavioral insights, and one 
could imagine mapping the connections between similar 
categories of motivations.The Behavior-Centered Design Journey

A snapshot of Tinambac, 2010-2014
• 12,000 households
• Average household size of 5 people
• Average monthly income of fishers is USD$40-65  
or less
• Fishers see themselves as the main providers for  
their families
• Primary fishing gear and methods: nets, hook and 
line, spear fishing, cyanide fishing, dynamite fishing, 
seaweed farming, compressor, bottom-set longline  
and traps
• Marine Protected Area (MPA, sanctuary) ordinance 
written by local leaders and established in 2006 
• Regulations, penalties, incentives, and local enforcement are a part of the MPA ordinance
• Fisher registration is a hassle and requires a lot of time and travel to complete
• Local government has begun to get involved in the community and provides financial support for MPA
• 95 percent of residents claim knowledge about the importance of sanctuaries but still believe that they, not the 
sanctuary, are the law 
• Fishing regulations are not working and violations are commonplace
• Strong place-based identity and feelings of ownership of natural resources 
• Strong spiritual and religious beliefs that fish resources are limitless and that God’s will and nature will replenish 
stocks through the rain and sunshine
• Fishers find it hard to identify the boundaries of the MPA in the municipal waters
• Distrust of outside interventions due to numerous failed livelihood projects in the area over the years
As a result, we hypothesized that fishers will be motivated 
to do the four key behaviors if we appeal to key values 
in the community, help to establish visible social norms, 
expectations, and peer enforcement in accordance with 
local regulations, leverage key influencers such as family 
members and the local mayor, and it easier to register and 
recognize the boundaries of the MPA.
Ideate
During the Ideate step, it is time to brainstorm, 
bundle, and balance intervention ideas based 
on your findings. This is where the strategies for applying 
behavioral science outlined in Chapter 3 of this report intersect with the specific challenge and audience for which 
you are designing. Ideate starts with brainstorming a list of 
ideas that correspond to intersection points or key insights 
from the behavior map(s) and then combining ideas and 
prioritizing them based on your team’s capacity. Often 
times, it helps to start with “How might we…” questions to 
generate ideas. Below is a simplified example of what our 
own ideation for Tinambac might have generated and the 
related strategies presented in Chapter 3.

HOW MIGHT WE…? POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS (STRATEGY #)
Leverage local values to guide  
desired behavior? • Use framings related to religion, spirituality (2)
• Use framings related to pride and ownership of place (1)
Use key influencers in the fishers’ social 
network to encourage desired behavior?• Make local government support more visible and vocal (6, 8)
• Provide ways for fishers’ family members (wives, children) to get 
involved in promoting sustainable fishing behaviors (10)
• Promote more conversations among community members (6, 9)
Strengthen enforcement of local 
regulations and incentives using  
social and emotional appeals?• Incentivize local government action through offering a national grant 
that is dependent on fisher registration outcomes (5) 
• Support peer enforcement mechanisms and build trust and 
accountability as related to the community sense of justice (2, 9)
• Create visible and transparent co-management system between local 
communities and local government (8)
Make illegal behavior more visible  
to others?• Set up anonymous reporting system for locals to submit violations (11)
• Publicly show the consequences for someone who did not follow  
the rules (8)
Make behavior easier to do or remove 
hassle factors?• Bring registration process to local villages and create a simple, 
convenient system (11)
• Mark MPA boundaries with clear buoys (13, 14)
• Use a mascot who can demonstrate the desired behaviors in a clear 
and memorable way (13)
Provide knowledge and information 
in a way that helps to connect current 
behavior to local values and identities?• Frame information about the importance of the local fishery to connect 
with current knowledge and local values and identity (2)
Celebrate local accomplishments to date 
to build momentum for further action?• Frame efforts to date as time and resources invested and sacrifices 
made that will go to waste without ongoing maintenance (4)
• Help local government apply for awards about the progress of the local 
fishery (1, 12)
Support poverty-reducing initiatives 
to increase time and resources for 
sustainable behavior?• Create alternative livelihood programs (11)
• Establish savings clubs programs where community members can loan 
out money to those in need (2, 5)
The resulting intervention used a combination of many of 
the strategies above as to provide multiple motivations 
for each of the desired behaviors. After brainstorming and 
bundling, we balance out our intervention by considering 
the capacity of the team, resources available, and other 
constraints that might narrow our list of intervention ideas.
Prototype
Now, select the best intervention idea or bundle 
of ideas and develop a prototype (small-scale version) that captures its essential features. By creating 
a small-scale version of your intervention, you can 
experiment and estimate its success without investing a 
lot of resources.
One of the ideas Cathy prototyped in Tinambac was to 
create a mascot who could popularize the ideal fisher 
who adopted the four behaviors, called ‘ProFi.’ Short for 
‘professional fisher,’ ProFi sought to borrow a respected 
title often used for academic professors to make fishing, 
traditionally seen as a livelihood of last resort, something

for fishers to be proud of and community members 
to respect. ProFi would represent a sustainable fisher 
identity and demonstrate the appropriate managed access 
behaviors publicly. Additionally, when fishers became 
registered, they would become known themselves as 
‘professional fishers’, or ProFis. This idea incorporated 
insights from our previous steps through a) making fishing 
something to be proud of; b) strengthening fishers’ 
sense they are part of a group to give them a reason to 
cooperate; c) making their behavior observable so there’s a 
social benefit to doing it; and d) creating a memorable and 
simplified way to engage with the four key behaviors.
ProFi prototype demonstrating the four  
key behaviors:
Test
Before launching your intervention at any scale, it 
is valuable to gain feedback from a few members 
of your target audience and then make revisions. Testing 
can occur at multiple scales, from something as simple as 
rapid user feedback from individuals and focus groups, to 
more sophisticated experimental trials (see Annex B).
Cathy and her team created a ProFi mascot who appeared 
at community events and began to affix the ProFi brand 
to various components of her intervention in Tinambac. 
With its early success, she knew that this would be a good 
strategy to use in a full-scale intervention.
Launch
When the intervention has been sufficiently 
tested and revised, it is time to launch at full-
scale. This might mean at the full audience or community-
wide scale as well as incorporating additional strategies 
from the Ideate step. In Cathy’s case, early successes 
with the ProFi idea in Tinambac were so promising that the 
ProFi brand was quickly scaled across more sustainable fisheries management project sites in the Philippines, 
where they are still being piloted today to encourage a 
wider set of behaviors. During this step, we also need 
to define metrics for evaluating our intervention that will 
guide our assessment in the next step. For this example, 
we’ll focus on the relative health of the fishery and 
community pre- and post- intervention.
Assess
Intertwined with full-scale launch and implementation 
is the critical importance of assessing the impact of 
your intervention and reflecting on potential improvements. 
This step helps us know if behavior change is happening 
and to what degree, so we can share our success, but more 
importantly, so we can adapt and revise the intervention as 
needed. Particularly in a case like overfishing and sustainable 
fisheries management, solving for a complex adaptive 
system means that the system itself and the behaviors 
that it influences are themselves continuously in flux, and 
therefore no single intervention is a permanent and constant 
solution. One of the major success indicators for Tinambac 
was fish biomass. As a result of the ProFi campaign, fish 
biomass in the MPA increased from 33 tons per km2 prior to 
intervention to 55 tons per km2 four years later.201

Conclusion
People are and will always be inextricably linked to nature. 
For the sake of those with whom we share this planet 
– human and otherwise – we all need to make different 
choices about how we interact with other species and 
natural resources. Conservationists have therefore always 
been in the business of behavior change, though this is 
only recently becoming recognized as fundamental to all 
our work.
There is a long list of valiant efforts by governments, 
NGOs, local communities, and individuals to protect our 
natural environment. Many of these have brought fantastic 
success. Many others have not. And many, regrettably, 
have lacked the rigorous evaluation necessary to know 
one way or the other. But as we’ve seen, for the most part 
they have drawn upon a set of tools that are incomplete. 
As powerful as regulations, incentives, and education 
are, and important as their continued use will be, recent 
behavioral science offers us new ways of thinking about 
the challenges we face.
We started this report by identifying some of the 
behavioral problems we need to address. We hope that 
in reading the enclosed chapters you now have some 
ideas as to how you might tackle these problems and feel 
more equipped to do your own work differently. Due to 
the wealth of information we now possess about human 
behavior, we have a huge opportunity to apply these 
insights and transform conservation threats into real-world 
solutions. While behavioral insights may not hold all the answers, we do know that they are a crucial part to making 
behavior change happen in the short and long term. We 
encourage you to take what you’ve learned here and 
test the strategies for yourself. This is about using good 
behavioral science, but also about good measurement and 
evaluation. Human behavior is complex, and change is 
difficult. It is therefore imperative that whatever tools we 
are using, we robustly measure their impact so that we 
can learn. Without integrating this evaluative approach, we 
cannot build on our successes nor learn from our failures.
Moreover, there are certain topics we did not cover in this 
report, and there are many additional target behaviors to 
those we listed in Chapter 1. Whether it’s climate change, 
invasive species, animal welfare, or water consumption, 
the strategies we’ve shared are applicable across all 
domains of human behavior. We hope that this report 
empowers you with a set of tools to be a change agent in 
your field of work, whatever it may be. 
If you’re interested in working with us directly on your 
conservation challenge, we’d be interested to learn more 
and connect about how we can support you. You can find 
contact information and resources on our websites at 
www.bi.team and www.rare.org/center. We look forward 
to hearing from you and hope you’ll join us in designing 
behaviorally-informed conservation solutions.

Annex B
A GUIDE TO THE ROBUST 
EVALUATION OF BEHAVIORAL 
INTERVENTIONS
This annex outlines BIT’s typical approach to running 
robust impact evaluations of behavioral interventions and 
campaigns.
Introduction
Human behavior is complex, unpredictable, and context-
dependent. As such we can never be sure, even with the 
best understanding of the behavioral literature that our 
intervention is going to be effective. History is littered 
with examples of ‘common sense’ initiatives, which, years 
later under scrutiny, were found to be ineffective or even 
harmful. For example, the administration of steroids for 
head injuries to reduce inflammation was standard practice 
until as late as 2005, when a large-scale evaluation found 
them to significantly increase mortalities.254 Moreover, 
even if we’re confident our intervention will have a positive 
impact, we don’t know to what magnitude — a critical 
piece of information when trading off different options or 
allocating finite budgets.
And so behavioral insights projects are not just about 
the novel behavioral science but are also fundamentally 
about taking an empirical and humble approach to find 
out ‘what works’ in the real world. This requires constant 
evaluation, supported by a sophisticated set of research 
and evaluation tools. These tools are often absent 
from the field of conservation, partly because genuine 
challenges exist, such as measuring illicit behaviors like 
the consumption of ivory products. But much more can 
be done using tools that have become standard practice in 
other fields such as medicine, international development, 
and public health. The following steps are key to designing 
robust evaluations.
STEP 1: IDENTIFY YOUR RESEARCH 
QUESTIONS (AND KNOW WHAT 
KIND OF EVALUATION YOU’RE 
RUNNING)
Good research usually starts with a firm understanding 
of what questions or hypotheses you intend to answer. 
To avoid confusion from the beginning, it is useful to 
recognize the type of questions you are posing, which we 
break into four categories:Impact evaluation. 
This is research intended to quantify the impact of 
an intervention or policy change on the outcomes of 
interest. Probably the most common type of evaluation, 
this aims to answer questions like, “What is the impact 
of my campaign on the consumption of rhino horn?” or 
“What is the impact of new enforcement processes on 
compliance with no-take zones?”
Subgroup (segment) analysis.
This is usually supplementary to an impact evaluation 
and research intended to illuminate variation in 
impact between subgroups. This aims to answer 
questions such as, "To what extent does the impact of my 
campaign differ for men and women, or between those 
who have a previous record of corruption versus those that 
don’t?”
Process evaluation. 
This is also often supplementary to an impact 
evaluation and aims to understand the ‘how’ and 
‘why’ of the intervention’s impact. A pure impact 
evaluation may only look at the final outcome of an 
intervention, whereas a process evaluation allows us to 
‘open the black box’ and thus understand the impact of an 
intervention in more nuanced terms. It seeks to evaluate 
the mechanisms through which the intervention works and 
understand the delivery of the intervention to identify any 
problems.  
 
Knowing the mechanics of an intervention’s success helps 
us extrapolate beyond the context of the particular trial 
and predict when, where, and with whom an intervention 
might work more broadly. Process evaluations can also 
be used as a diagnostic tool to help us understand any 
issues in delivery of the intervention, such that it might 
be improved next time. Typical questions include the 
following: What were the recipients’ experiences of the 
intervention?; What were the motives for changing their 
behavior?; Did all intended recipients actually receive 
the intervention?; and Why did some not act on it? In 
this manner process evaluations are also integral to the 
development of a ‘theory-of-change,’ which aims to 
illustrate the mechanisms and logic of an intervention’s 
impact. Bear in mind a process evaluation may have 
its own segment analysis associated with it, i.e., does 
the mechanism of the intervention differ for different 
segments of the population?

behavioral scientists the ultimate impact, on fish stocks, is 
not our primary concern

behavioral scientists the ultimate impact, on fish stocks, is 
not our primary concern. In other words, we are seeking 
to promote compliance because we already know that 
increased compliance is good for fish stocks. If it is not 
known that no-take zones are good for fish stocks, then 
certainly this should be evaluated as the first priority, 
but it is a different research question and not one best 
answered through a social norms intervention. In reality, 
research is driven by pragmatism, compromise, and 
budget constraints, and so there may be reason to include 
an outcome on actual fish stocks. We should at least 
recognize this as an extension of the direct objective of the 
intervention that is to increase compliance among fishers.
STEP 3: IDENTIFY THE BEST 
RESEARCH DESIGN AND TOOLS
With the main objective being to run an impact evaluation 
of a particular behavior change intervention or campaign 
(and with subgroup analysis, process evaluations, 
and exploratory research being additional elements of 
this, rather than standalone objectives), we must next 
determine the best research design. A wide range of 
options is available.
Randomized controlled trials
Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are the ‘gold standard’ 
of impact evaluation research designs. They aim to 
identify the causal impact of an intervention or some other 
change on outcome(s) of interest. They do this robustly by 
incorporating two key components: 1) the presence of a 
counterfactual sample who do not receive the intervention 
(creating a ‘treatment’ and ‘control’ group), and 2) random 
assignment of the sample population into these two 
groups (or more, as there may be multiple different 
‘treatments’ we wish to compare against the control 
and each other, such as different variants of campaign 
materials).  
 
The purpose of the control group is to identify what would 
have happened without the intervention. Without this 
counterfactual, it would be impossible to attribute any 
differences we see in our outcomes to the intervention 
itself, as other extraneous factors may have confounded 
us. For example, if we want to measure the impact of 
a campaign on meat consumption among US citizens, 
a  Note that by randomly allocating our treatment across a large sample, we can rely on the randomisation to ensure our two groups are balanced (equivalent) 
at baseline (before intervention). We therefore do not need to collect data before the intervention. However, it is nonetheless common to run ‘balance checks’ 
to ensure randomisation has successfully created equivalent groups – these are statistical comparisons between the two groups on the outcome measures of 
interest at baseline (if the outcome measure can be measured at this point), and on other characteristics such as key demographic variables.
b  Note that random allocation to the treatment/control groups is not the same thing as ‘random sampling’, by which we generate our whole trial population 
from a random sample of the wider population of interest, to ensure the results are representative of that population (see comments on ‘representativeness’ 
later)..
c  Note that an ‘A-B design’ is essentially an RCT, but comparing two variations of an intervention of process (A and B) with no control group. This is 
appropriate if we want to know which version performs better, but are uninterested in their absolute impact relative to nothing.a subsequent drop in meat consumption may be down 
to our campaign or may have happened anyway due to 
wider, cultural shifts. Only a good counterfactual group 
(who also experience the same cultural shifts, but don’t 
experience the campaign) can address this problem. The 
purpose of allocating the sample randomly is to ensure that 
the two or more groups are like-for-like in every respect 
except for their receipt of the intervention (treatment). 
Randomization achieves this if the sample size is large 
enough (through the law of large numbers).a Small samples 
risk ‘randomization failure’ (imbalance between the groups 
on confounding factors). This is one of the two major 
reasons for having large samples in experiments, the other 
reason being to maximize statistical power (our chance 
of detecting an impact of the intervention, if one really 
exists).b
We outline the basic structure of an RCT below.c
Randomization strategy and clustering  
When we randomly allocate our intervention to a 
sample population, we must be wary of spillover and 
contamination. Spillover occurs where those in the 
treatment group interact with the control participants, 
who therefore indirectly benefit from treatment. For 
example, if testing an educational intervention, we might 
attempt to deliver it to half the students but not the 
others; however, since students talk to each other, those 
in the control group might indirectly be exposed to the 
treatment. A similar concept, contamination occurs where 
control participants directly receive treatment, perhaps 
because a treatment is delivered in one region, and control 
participants from another region travel into the treatment 
region.
Both spillover and contamination undermine our ability to 
robustly estimate the true impact of the intervention. The 
most common solution is to ‘cluster’ treatment delivery, 
randomizing by, say, classroom or perhaps by school,

or need to be able to detect (smaller differences between 
groups require larger samples to detect, so in the above 
example, if we received 60 percent heads instead of 75 
percent, we would need to toss the coin more times 
before being sure it was weighted).
Representativeness  
A finding is considered representative if it can be 
generalized to the wider population to which the 
intervention might apply. For example, if we only run 
a pilot experiment in one region, we may be unable to 
generalize results to other regions, if other regions differ 
on characteristics that might alter their response to our 
intervention. Similarly, if severe self-selection bias occurs 
such that only a particular ‘type’ of person receives the 
intervention during a trial, we may use matching or another 
quasi-experimental technique to generate a comparable 
control group and thus robustly estimate the impact of the 
intervention on that group of people, although the result 
might not be representative of the wider population. It can 
be helpful to run representativeness checks on the treated 
sample population, comparing their key demographics 
against datasets from the wider population. 
STEP 4: PRE-SPECIFY YOUR 
RESEARCH PROTOCOL AND  
THEN LAUNCH THE TRIAL AND 
COLLECT DATA
Researcher bias, seeking out and focusing on the result 
we would like to see, is a very real problem even among 
the most conscientious researchers. For instance, if 
the data suggest our intervention had no impact, we’d be more inclined to triple-check the analysis and run 
additional tests on secondary outcome measures than if 
we find a significant effect. It is therefore good practice 
to pre-specify the research and evaluation strategy before 
data are collected, clearly specifying the hypotheses, the 
primary analysis and outcomes, and the statistical tests to 
be used. Additional tests on other outcomes or alternative 
statistical analysis can be undertaken but would generally 
be secondary or exploratory, and thus not detract from the 
main result.
As you can see from these steps, there is a lot to consider 
when rigorously evaluating a behavioral intervention. We 
recognize it is not easy and hope that these steps give you 
some resources, tools, and insights moving forward.

## Chunk 42: Rare inspires change so people and nature thrive

**Page Reference:** p. 83

**Citation:** (BIT, 2019, p. 83)

**Keywords:** policy, government, behavioral science, behavioral insight, intervention

**Content:**

Rare inspires change so people and nature thrive. Conservation ultimately comes down to people – their behaviors 
toward nature, their beliefs about its value, and their ability to protect it without sacrificing basic life needs. And so, 
conservationists must become as skilled in social change as in science; as committed to community-based solutions as 
national and international policymaking.
The Center for Behavior & the Environment at Rare is bringing the best insights from behavioral science and design to tackle 
some of the world’s most challenging environmental issues. Through partnerships with leading academic and research 
institutions, we are translating the science of human behavior into practical solutions for conservationists worldwide.
Learn more at rare.org and follow us @Rare_org.The Behavioral Insights Team exists to improve people’s lives and communities. We work in partnership with governments, 
local authorities, businesses and charities, often using simple changes to tackle major policy and social problems. In 2010 we 
were created as the world's first government institution dedicated to the application of behavioral science, and have since 
grown from a seven-person unit at the heart of the UK government to a global social purpose company with offices around 
the world.
Our mission today remains the same. We generate and apply behavioral insights to inform policy, improve public services 
and deliver results for citizens and society. We do this using the utmost rigor in scientific method, so that we can learn what 
works, and what doesn't. We have a track record of success across a range of policy areas, from healthcare to humanitarian 
aid, economic growth to early years, social capital to sustainability. We also work to scale our successful interventions by 
sharing lessons and supporting wider adoption and spread of what works.
