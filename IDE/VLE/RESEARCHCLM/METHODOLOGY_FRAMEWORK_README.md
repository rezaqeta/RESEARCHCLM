## 🎓 Framework Philosophy

This framework is built on five principles:

### 1. **Question-Driven** ❓
Your research question should drive methodology choice, not the other way around.

### 2. **Theory-Grounded** 🧠
Strong behavioral science theory (especially COM-B) guides design and analysis.

### 3. **Pragmatic** 🔧
Recommendations balance scientific rigor with practical feasibility.

### 4. **Comprehensive** 📊
Mixed methods provide the most complete understanding (but not always necessary).

### 5. **Actionable** 🎯
Research should generate practical insights for policy and practice.

✅ **Answers your specific research question**  
✅ **Is grounded in established theory** (COM-B, TPB, etc.)  
✅ **Uses appropriate research design** for your question  
✅ **Has adequate sample size** (justified by power analysis or saturation)  
✅ **Uses valid, reliable measures** (validated scales or rigorous qual methods)  
✅ **Controls for bias** and confounds  
✅ **Meets ethical standards** (informed consent, privacy, etc.)  
✅ **Is feasible** with your resources and timeline  
✅ **Produces actionable results** for theory and/or practice

## 🔄 Iterate and Improve

Remember: Research methodology is iterative!

```
Plan → Pilot → Refine → Execute → Learn → Improve
   ↑                                          ↓
   ←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←← Feedback ←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←
```

**It's okay if**:
- Your first plan changes after pilot testing
- You discover unexpected findings
- You need to adapt during data collection
- Results aren't what you expected

**What matters**:
- Transparency about changes and reasons
- Systematic, rigorous approach
- Honest reporting of limitations
- Learning from the process

## 🆘 Common Questions Answered

### Q: "Which methodology should I choose?"
**A**: Start with your research question. What do you want to know?
- "Does X work?" → Experimental (A) or Mixed (D)
- "Why does Y happen?" → Qualitative (C) or Mixed (D)
- "What's known about Z?" → Review (B)

### Q: "I don't have access to large samples. Now what?"
**A**: Go qualitative! Rich insights from 20-30 interviews are valuable and publishable. Or do a systematic review.

### Q: "Is my study too small/simple?"
**A**: Small and rigorous > large and sloppy. Focus on quality. Every study contributes to the bigger picture.

### Q: "Can I combine methodologies?"
**A**: Yes! Mixed methods (D) combines quantitative and qualitative. Start with one, add another in a second phase.

### Q: "I don't know statistics well. Can I still do quantitative research?"
**A**: Yes, but get help! Hire a statistical consultant or collaborate with someone with stats expertise. Or start with descriptive studies.

### Q: "How do I know if my measures are good?"
**A**: Use validated scales from published research when possible. If creating new measures, pilot test and check reliability (Cronbach's α).

### Q: "What if I don't find significant results?"
**A**: Null results are still results! Report them honestly, explore why with qualitative follow-up, discuss implications.

### Q: "I'm feeling overwhelmed. Where do I start?"
**A**: 
1. Print the Quick Reference Card
2. Read the Decision Guide
3. Choose ONE methodology
4. Fill out just Section 1-4 of the protocol template
5. Get feedback
6. Continue step by step

### Q: "Can I modify this framework for my specific context?"
**A**: Absolutely! This is a template. Adapt to your specific research question, context, and constraints.
