# Research Methodology Quick Reference Card
## Behavioral Science × Environmental Behavior Change

## 🎯 THE GOLDEN RULE
**Let your research question drive your methodology choice, not the other way around!**

---

## 📋 Four Main Approaches

### 1️⃣ EXPERIMENTAL STUDY (Test Intervention)
**Question**: "Does this intervention work?"  
**Design**: Intervention vs. Control, Pre-Post-Follow-up  
**Sample**: 100-300 participants  
**Timeline**: 12-18 months  
**Output**: Effect size, causal evidence  
**Best for**: Testing specific behavioral interventions

---

### 2️⃣ QUALITATIVE STUDY (Understand Deeply)
**Question**: "Why do people behave this way?"  
**Design**: Interviews or focus groups  
**Sample**: 20-30 interviews  
**Timeline**: 8-12 months  
**Output**: Themes, mechanisms, rich insights  
**Best for**: Exploratory research, understanding barriers/facilitators

---

### 3️⃣ SYSTEMATIC REVIEW (Synthesize Evidence)
**Question**: "What does existing research tell us?"  
**Design**: Literature search, screening, synthesis  
**Sample**: Existing published studies  
**Timeline**: 6-12 months  
**Output**: Evidence summary, research gaps  
**Best for**: Foundation before primary research

---

### 4️⃣ MIXED METHODS (Comprehensive)
**Question**: "Does it work AND why?"  
**Design**: Quant study → Qual interviews → Integration  
**Sample**: 200-300 + 20-30 interviews  
**Timeline**: 18-24 months  
**Output**: Effectiveness + mechanisms  
**Best for**: Comprehensive understanding, high-impact research

---

## 🧠 Theoretical Framework: COM-B Model

**Behavior happens when you have:**

**C** = CAPABILITY (knowledge, skills)  
**O** = OPPORTUNITY (environment, social support)  
**M** = MOTIVATION (attitudes, emotions)  

**→ B** = BEHAVIOR

*Use this to design interventions and organize your findings.*

## 📊 Key Variables to Measure

### Behaviors (Outcome)
- Energy/water use
- Recycling/waste
- Transportation choices
- Food/consumption
- (Objective data > Self-report)

### Psychological Factors
- ✓ Knowledge (capability)
- ✓ Self-efficacy (capability)
- ✓ Attitudes (motivation)
- ✓ Social norms (opportunity)
- ✓ Barriers/facilitators (opportunity)

### Controls
- Age, gender, education
- Income, location
- Baseline behavior

## ✅ Research Quality Checklist

### Quantitative:
- [ ] Power analysis (adequate sample size)
- [ ] Validated measurement scales
- [ ] Control group (for causation)
- [ ] Pre-post measurement
- [ ] Follow-up (sustained change?)
- [ ] Effect sizes reported
- [ ] Control for confounds

### Qualitative:
- [ ] Purposive sampling
- [ ] Interview guide piloted
- [ ] Interviews recorded & transcribed
- [ ] Two coders (inter-rater reliability)
- [ ] Thematic saturation reached
- [ ] Member checking
- [ ] Rich quotes provided

### Both:
- [ ] Research question clearly defined
- [ ] Theory/framework explicit
- [ ] Ethics approval obtained
- [ ] Informed consent process
- [ ] Limitations acknowledged
- [ ] Transparent reporting

## 📈 Sample Size Guidelines

| Study Type | Minimum | Recommended |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| RCT/Quasi-experimental | 128 (64/group) | 200-300 |
| Survey (correlational) | 200 | 300-500 |
| Interviews | 15-20 | 25-30 |
| Focus groups | 3-4 groups | 4-6 groups |

*Always conduct power analysis for quantitative studies!*

---

## 🔬 Analysis Quick Guide

### Quantitative:
- **Compare groups**: t-test, ANOVA
- **Predict behavior**: Regression
- **Test mechanisms**: Mediation analysis (PROCESS macro)
- **Before/after**: Repeated measures ANOVA
- **Software**: SPSS, R, Stata

### Qualitative:
- **Approach**: Thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke)
- **Process**: Familiarization → Coding → Themes
- **Framework**: Use COM-B to organize
- **Software**: NVivo, ATLAS.ti, or manual

### Mixed:
- **Integration**: Joint display tables
- **Strategy**: Use qual to explain quant findings

## ⏱️ Typical Timeline (18-month study)

| Month | Activity |
|-------|----------|
| 1-3 | Literature review, design, ethics |
| 4 | Pilot test |
| 5-10 | Data collection |
| 11-14 | Analysis |
| 15-18 | Writing, submission |

*Build in 20% buffer time for delays!*

---

## 💰 Budget Essentials

- Participant incentives ($10-30 per person)
- Survey software (Qualtrics, SurveyMonkey)
- Analysis software (SPSS ~$200, or free R/jamovi)
- Transcription ($1-2/minute or DIY)
- Open-access publication fee (~$2000-3000)

*Minimum viable budget: $1,000-2,000*

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. ❌ **Choosing method before question** → Define question first!
2. ❌ **Sample too small** → Do power analysis
3. ❌ **No pilot testing** → Always pilot!
4. ❌ **Self-report bias** → Use objective measures when possible
5. ❌ **No follow-up** → Assess sustained change
6. ❌ **Ignoring theory** → Ground in established frameworks
7. ❌ **Poor measurement** → Use validated scales
8. ❌ **No control group** → Can't establish causation
9. ❌ **Overpromising** → Be realistic about scope
10. ❌ **Ethics afterthought** → Get approval early!

## 🆘 When You're Stuck

**Question**: "I don't know which methodology to choose"  
**Answer**: What can you answer only with numbers? Only with stories? Both?

**Question**: "My sample size is too small for statistics"  
**Answer**: Go qualitative! Rich insights from 20 people > weak stats from 50

**Question**: "I can't recruit participants"  
**Answer**: 1) Increase incentives, 2) Partner with organizations, 3) Online recruitment

**Question**: "My results aren't significant"  
**Answer**: Report effect sizes, discuss practical significance, explore in qual follow-up

**Question**: "Behavior didn't change"  
**Answer**: That's a finding! Explore why in interviews, discuss barriers

**Question**: "Too much data, overwhelmed"  
**Answer**: Go back to research questions, focus analysis on what matters most

## ✨ Remember

> "The best methodology is the one that answers YOUR question with YOUR resources in YOUR context."

- Start simple, scale later
- Pilot everything
- Theory guides design
- Report honestly (including null results)
- Ask for help (advisors, peers, experts)
- Iterate and improve
